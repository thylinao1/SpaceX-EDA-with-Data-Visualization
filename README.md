ðŸ“Š IBM Data Science Capstone â€“ EDA with Data Visualization

This notebook explores the SpaceX launch dataset using exploratory data analysis and visualization to uncover patterns that influence mission success.

ðŸ§© Notebook: edadataviz.ipynb

Objective
To visualize and understand how various factors such as payload mass, launch site, orbit type, and booster version affect the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches.

ðŸ§­ Key Visualizations and Purpose
Visualization	Purpose / Insight
Flight Number vs Launch Site: Understand experience effect â€” more flights generally lead to higher success rates.
Payload Mass (kg) vs Launch Site:	Examine if heavier payloads influence success probabilities.
Success Rate vs Orbit: Identify which orbit types have historically higher success rates.
Yearly Success Trend: Observe improvement in success rate over time due to booster technology.
Booster Version vs Success Rate:	Assess performance improvement with newer rocket versions.

ðŸ§° Tools Used

Python,pandas,matplotlib, seaborn
